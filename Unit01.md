**Unit 1: Functions, Graphs, and Limits** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit begins with a review of functions that should have been
learned in a previous course. Specifically, we will examine the
relationship between formulas and graphs of functions, as well as
general properties of their graphs. After completing the first part of
this unit, you should feel comfortable explaining general patterns that
occur in certain types of functions, as well as be able to give specific
information about a graph given its formula. After studying functions,
we will examine the first “big” topic in calculus, the limit. As you
will see, much of calculus is based on this concept, so it is important
to have a good understanding of its fundamental meaning now. We will
study limits as they relate to graphs and formulas, and we will use
formal limit notation to explain certain behaviors of graphs that you
have studied before (such as continuity), but without the concept of
limits. This is a very exciting unit and it is important to understand
limits well before moving on to the next part of the course.*

**1.1 Analysis of Graphs** <span id="1.1"></span> 
Functions can model real-life scenarios to determine the relationship
among variables. One example is linear modeling, which can compare
supply and demand models. This concept is used during the Christmas
shopping season to see if the supply of the hot new toy is available to
meet consumer demand. Nonlinear modeling occurs when the relationship
fluctuates between the dependent and independent variables. An example
is the number of bacteria growing in a petri dish, which can occur at an
exponential rate. Functions can also be compared with the parent
function by looking at the transformations of the function.  
    
 Subunit 1.1 contains a review of properties of functions and their
graphs, including intercepts, symmetry, domain, and range. The
properties discussed in this subunit will be applied to functions
throughout the course.

**1.2 Limits of Functions (including one-sided limits)** <span
id="1.2"></span> 
There are limits to many things around us, including algebraic
functions. Limits can help us find values that are not possible in other
aspects of mathematics, including the velocity of a falling object as
well as the area under curves. Other examples include the population of
certain animals, depending on predators and food sources, as well as the
instant speed of an object. Limits allow us to explore what occurs with
a function when the dependent variable approaches a certain value.  
    
 Subunit 1.2 discusses the fundamental concept of a limit, which is a
critical definition for calculus. This subunit will require you to find
limits, including one-sided and infinite limits, graphically and
algebraically. This subunit also helps you identify the properties of
limits and cases where limits do not exist.

**1.3 Continuity as a Property of Functions** <span id="1.3"></span> 
Some functions are continuous, while others are not, which is evident
when looking at a graph of a function. Discontinuity can occur when
there are rational functions, and examples are cost of a product and
medical interactions. The speed of an automobile during heavy traffic is
where one can see continuity in action because at times you are moving
at a constant speed and at other times the car has stopped.  
    
 Subunit 1.3 explores the continuity as a property of functions.
Continuity is evident in various calculus theorems as well as in
one-sided limits. This concept will be applied when looking at functions
within unit 2.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read this section
    on finding limits, stopping at “Review Questions.” Watch the videos
    in the section as well. This reading discusses how to understand
    continuous function properties, one-sided limits, and solving
    problems using the min-max and intermediate value theorem.  
        
     Reading, taking notes, and viewing these videos should take
    approximately 1 hour.
