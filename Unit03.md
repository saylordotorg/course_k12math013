**Unit 3: Integrals** <span id="3"></span> 
*Integrals are the final unit in this course. In a similar way to
derivatives, you will approach integrals first by learning their formal
definition, then by learning techniques by which to compute them, and
then lastly learning about their applications. In this unit, you will
also learn the FTC (fundamental theorem of calculus), learn to solve
basic differential equations, and also learn some cool approximation
techniques. One of the reasons this unit is really interesting is
because of all the cool images that can be generated using integrals.
You will see what this means very soon!*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 65.25 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   Explain in various ways how the definite integral is equal to a
    limit of Riemann sums.
-   Explain the definite integral of a rate of change over an interval
    as the change of a quantity over the interval [integral from a to b
    of f<span
    style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Symbol; font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;">¢</span>(x)dx
    = f(b) – f(a) ].
-   Use basic properties of definite integrals (such as additivity and
    linearity) to solve more complex integrals.
-   Find basic antiderivatives based on known derivatives of basic
    functions.
-   Find more complex antiderivatives by substitution of variables and
    changing of limits.
-   Use the FTC to evaluate definite integrals.
-   Use the FTC to represent a particular antiderivative both
    analytically and graphically.
-   Use appropriate integrals to model physical, biological, and
    economic scenarios.
-   Use appropriate definite integrals in other situations by setting up
    an approximating Riemann sum and taking its limit in:
    -   Finding the area of a region.
    -   Finding the volume of a solid with known cross sections.
    -   Finding the average value of a function.
    -   Finding the distance travelled by a particle along a path.

    involving motion along a line).
-   Solve separable differential equations and use them in modeling
    (specifically studying y<span
    style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Symbol; font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;">¢</span>=
    ky and exponential growth).

    integrals of functions represented algebraically, graphically, and
    by tables of values.
-   Use trapezoidal sums to approximate definite integrals of functions
    represented algebraically, graphically, and by tables of values. 

**3.1 Techniques of Antidifferentiation (Integration)** <span
id="3.1"></span> 
Antidifferentiation (integration) can model real-life applications to
determine the relationship among functions or a group of functions.
Integration rules can help you eventually solve problems in multiple
dimensions. Antidifferentiation is the opposite operation of
differentiation, and this allows you to find values, such as areas under
a curve, that are challenging without these concepts.  
    
 Subunit 3.1 focuses on the various techniques of antidifferentiation
(integration) used in calculus. The subunit starts with the basic rules
of antidifferentiation and then moves on to specialized cases such as
trigonometry, integration by parts, integration by substitution, and
partial fractions. These methods are critical to understanding definite
integrals and additional calculus-related applications.

**3.2 Interpretations and Properties of Definite Integrals** <span
id="3.2"></span> 
Definite integrals allow us to find the exact area underneath a curve.
Without these integrals, it would be very difficult to even estimate the
area under a curve that is not a linear function. The rules of
integration allow us to find the area underneath any function.  
    
 Subunit 3.2 focuses on finding definite integrals for various
functions. The rules of integration learned in subunit 3.1 will be
explored further as we work to find the exact values of integrals over a
given region.

**3.3 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** <span id="3.3"></span> 
How are a derivative and an integral related? The fundamental theorem of
calculus ties these concepts together and helps us to quickly find the
area underneath the curve of a function. This theorem allows us to
perform complex calculations at a faster rate using a very simple
rule.  
    
 The fundamental theorem of calculus provides us with another approach
to finding definite integrals and is used when multiple functions are
involved in finding a specific area.

**3.4 Improper Integrals** <span id="3.4"></span> 
What happens when an integral is undefined? What can we use when one of
the values on the interval is infinite? Improper integrals help us
define integrals when the fundamental theorem of calculus cannot be used
because the interval is not continuous. Since not all functions are
continuous within each interval, other approaches need to be used to
find the value of the definite integral.  
    
 This subunit defines how to find the values of improper integrals using
a variety of techniques. One approach is used when infinity is contained
in the interval and limits are used. Another approach is used when there
is discontinuity within the integral.

**3.5 Applications of Integrals** <span id="3.5"></span> 
Applications of integrals are plentiful and allow one to find
calculations to complex functions. With rules of integrals, we can find
the area under a curve, and by expanding this rule, we can find the
volume between curves. One example is determining the amount of work
required to lift a bucket attached to a cable. Finding distance,
velocity, and acceleration of an object being shot in the area is
another application of integrals.  
    
 Subunit 3.5 explores the many applications of integrals. These include
the area between curves, the volumes of various figures, the length of
plane curves, and the area of various surfaces. There are also many
applications within other disciplines that will be explored in this
subunit.

**3.6 Numerical Approximations to Definite Integrals** <span
id="3.6"></span> 
There are times when the antiderivative is very challenging to find or
may not even exist, which means the definite integral cannot be
evaluated. What can one do in this case when the integral cannot be
found? Three approaches can be taken to find the approximate value of
the region under a curve.  
    
 Subunit 3.6 looks at various ways to use numerical approximations to
find definite integrals. The Riemann sum, trapezoidal rule, and
Simpson’s rule can all be used to find an accurate approximation of an
area under a curve.
