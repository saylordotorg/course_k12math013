**Unit 2: Derivatives** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn first the concept of a derivative by
explaining it through limits. You will see that the limit definition and
computation are drawn out, and often difficult, so you will learn
shortcuts to compute derivatives. You will learn to compute derivatives
for all different types of functions, as well as for combinations of
functions. After you learn how to compute derivatives, you will look at
what derivatives tell you specifically at any point in a function, as
well as what they tell you about the function as a whole. You will
finish this unit by looking at the computation and meaning of second
derivatives, as well as real-life applications of derivatives. The main
applications to be reviewed in this unit will be related rates problems,
optimization problems, and problems involving displacement, velocity,
and acceleration.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 54.5 hours to complete.

**2.1 Concept of the Derivative** <span id="2.1"></span> 
The velocity of an airplane is not always consistent due to various
factors, including the fact that it does not travel in a straight line.
So, most people look at an average velocity to determine the speed of
the plane. Sometimes, there is an instantaneous velocity used to
determine the speed at a specific time. This is an example of how
derivatives are used to help determine specific and average amounts.  
    
 The idea of derivatives may be challenging at first, but it makes
concepts easier throughout the unit. You will start by using concepts
that you know, such as slope of a line and limits. These concepts will
be expanded further to help define a derivative.  
    
 Subunit 2.1 begins by defining the slope and slope of a tangent line.
Then, the slope of a tangent line for a point on a graph is used to
define a derivative. The derivative of a function is defined in this
section, also using the concept of limits.

**2.3 Mean Value Theorem** <span id="2.3"></span> 
Identifying maximum and minimum can be a challenging aspect of calculus,
especially with complex polynomial and trigonometric functions. These
points are valuable to determine when there is a maximum profit or
height as well as a minimum loss. There is a specific theorem that can
help us determine these values in an efficient manner.  
    
 Subunit 2.3 contains the mean value theorem, which is an important
theorem in calculus, where a number exists on the interval that
satisfies this theorem. Another important part of this theorem is
determining when functions are continuous and differentiable.

**2.4 L’Hopital’s Rule** <span id="2.4"></span> 
There are some instances in calculus where a limit cannot be determined
from the given information, but the limit does exist. There is a rule
that can be used along with previously learned concepts that can find
these unique limits.  
    
 Section 2.4 uses L’Hopital’s rule to explain limits at infinity when
the limit is in an indeterminate form. This rule can help define these
limits by applying rules of derivatives.

**2.5 Derivative as a Function** <span id="2.5"></span> 
The graph of a function has many key components that can be useful in
various scenarios. A graph can tell a company when it is making a
profit, when it is experiencing a loss, or when its revenues fluctuate
between profit and loss. A sine wave is a natural occurring pattern in
ocean, sound, and light waves. The graph of a function can also
determine maximum and minimum amount as well.  
    
 Subunit 2.5 highlights derivatives and their relationship to the graphs
of various functions. The first and second derivatives tests determine
important points on the graph as well as increasing and concavity
intervals. Other key components of graphing that are explored include
these: domain/range, asymptotes, and x- and y- intercepts.

**2.6 Applications of Derivatives** <span id="2.6"></span> 
Have you wondered how a measure is impacted by the rate of another
value? Have you wondered how to maximize the profits of selling an item
or determine the minimum amount of cost to make this item? Those in the
business of developing apps for smartphones analyze how much they can
sell an app for as well as the cost of creating the app. These ideas
determine whether the developer can proceed with the app development and
sale of the product. There are many applications of derivatives that
explore these concepts.  
    
 Subunit 2.6 highlights the applications of derivatives. The rate of
change and related rates are problems where a given rate is changing;
you are to find the rate at the value related to the changing rate.
Optimization problems determine the maximum and/or minimum amount of a
given scenario.
