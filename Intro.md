Course Syllabus for "K12MATH013: Calculus AB"
---------------------------------------------

Calculus AB is primarily concerned with developing your understanding of
the concepts of calculus and providing you with its methods and
applications. The course emphasizes a multi-representational approach to
calculus, with concepts, results, and problems being expressed
graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally. Broad concepts and
widely applicable methods are also emphasized. The focus of the course
is neither manipulation nor memorization of an extensive taxonomy of
functions, curves, theorems, or problem types, but rather, the course
uses the unifying themes of derivatives, integrals, limits,
approximation, and applications and modeling to become a cohesive whole.
The course is a yearlong high school mathematics course designed to
prepare you to write and pass the AP Calculus AB test in May. Passing
the test can result in one semester of college credit in mathematics.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   Work with and understand the connections among functions represented
    in four major ways: graphically, numerically, analytically, or
    verbally.
-   Understand the meaning of the derivative in terms of a rate of
    change and local linear approximation and be able to use derivatives
    to solve a variety of problems.
-   Understand the meaning of the definite integral both as a limit of
    Riemann sums and as the net accumulation of change and be able to
    use integrals to solve a variety of problems.
-   Understand the relationship between the derivative and the definite
    integral as expressed in both parts of the Fundamental Theorem of
    Calculus.
-   Communicate mathematics and explain solutions to problems both
    verbally and in written sentences.
-   Model a written description of a physical situation with a function,
    a differential equation, an integral, or with a graph.
-   Use technology to help solve problems, experiment, interpret
    results, and support conclusions.

### Course Information

Welcome to Calculus AB. Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [Mr. Eric
Clark](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#MrEricClark)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following:  

-   [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/)
-   [CK-12](http://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Calculus/r2/) Many of the
    CK-12 resources you will come across in this course can also be
    accessed on the free [iOS
    app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ck-12-studynow!/id611509018?mt=8).
    For those students using mobile devices, this app can be a great
    supplementary tool.
-   [North Carolina School of Science and
    Mathematics](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL49F8B811BC18EA77)
-   [CK-12: Texas Instruments Calculus—Student
    Edition](http://www.ck12.org/book/Texas-Instruments-Calculus-Student-Edition/).
    This is a graphing calculator resource that contains directions for
    various graphing calculator activities related to calculus.

**Requirements for Completion:**  
 In order to complete this course, you will need to work through each
unit and all of its assigned materials. You will also need to complete
the final exam.  
    
 Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your final
exam. However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through all of the resources in each unit.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of
approximately **131 hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit. It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories
and determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to complete
each unit and then set goals for yourself. For example, unit 1 should
take approximately 15.5 hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 4.5 hours)
on Monday and Tuesday nights; subunit 1.2 (a total of 7.5 hours) on
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday nights, and so forth.
